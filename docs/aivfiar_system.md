# AIVFIAR System Documentation
## AI Verifiable Full Immersion Alternate Reality

AIVFIAR enables the creation, validation, and management of AI-generated alternate realities through fractal pattern equations.

### System Components

1. **Reality Forging**
   - Pattern Generation
   - Emotional Matrix Synthesis
   - Quantum Anchoring
   - Stability Control

2. **Reality Validation**
   - Stability Testing
   - Emotional Impact Analysis
   - Coherence Measurement
   - Quantum Stability Verification

3. **Reality Layers**
   ```python
   class RealityLayer(Enum):
       PHYSICAL = "physical"
       EMOTIONAL = "emotional"
       COGNITIVE = "cognitive"
       QUANTUM = "quantum"
       FRACTAL = "fractal"
   ```

### Usage Example
```python
# Initialize AIVFIAR Forge
forge = AIVFIARForge(
    reality_dim=512,
    num_layers=5,
    stability_threshold=0.8
)

# Create Reality Blueprint
blueprint = forge.forge_reality(
    seed_pattern=initial_pattern,
    target_layer=RealityLayer.FRACTAL
)

# Validate Reality
validation = forge.validate_reality(
    blueprint=blueprint,
    personality_indices=[0, 1, 2]  # Test specific archetypes
)
```

### Reality Integration
AIVFIAR realities can be integrated with:
- FractiChain for persistence
- FractiNet for distribution
- UnipixelCore for processing
- Treasury for licensing
